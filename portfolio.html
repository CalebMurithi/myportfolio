                    <p>
                        I created this portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my skills, education, and projects. I designed it to be responsive and visually appealing, using a turquoise color scheme that reflects my professional brand. The website includes sections for my bio, education, projects, skills, and contact information. I built it from scratch without using any templates, ensuring it represents my personal coding abilities and attention to detail.

                    <h3>Choosing GitHub Pages for Hosting</h3>
                    <p>
                        I chose GitHub Pages as my hosting platform because it's free and perfect for developers like me. I created a repository named "calebmurithi.github.io" on GitHub and pushed all my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to it. GitHub Pages automatically deploys my website and makes it accessible at https://calebmurithi.github.io. This approach allowed me to host my portfolio without paying for traditional web hosting services while keeping my code version-controlled and easily manageable.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="domain-item">
                    <h3>Custom Domain Setup</h3>
                    <p>
                        I registered a custom domain name through a domain registrar to give my portfolio a more professional identity. I then connected this custom domain to my GitHub Pages hosting by updating the DNS records to point to GitHub's servers. This involved adding a CNAME file to my repository and configuring the domain settings. Now visitors can access my portfolio through both my GitHub Pages URL and my custom domain, giving me a branded online presence while enjoying benefits of GitHub Pages.
